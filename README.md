Hello There!
This is a basic flask application used to represent weather data using OpenWeatherMap API. It is made to work responsively with mobile screens only.
Responsive design for PCs and tablets is still in progress. You can use it as long as you attribute me.

Following are the frameworks and APIs used :

1. Flask
2. OpenWeatherMap API
3. Bootstrap CSS

Feel free to use this program. Happy coding ðŸ™‚
